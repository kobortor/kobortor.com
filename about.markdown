I graduated from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu/) with a Master in Computer Science, and [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca) with a Bachelor in Computer Science. During my masters, I did research into robust statistics with Pravesh Kothari. At Carnegie Mellon, I TA'd for 2 terms under Klaus Sutner, one for Undergrad Complexity Theory (15-455) and one for Computational and Discrete Math (15-354) where I received full score reviews from every student who submitted, comprising of more than half the class.

I currently work at [Tower Research Capital](https://www.tower-research.com/) as a Quant Trader. Previously, I interned in many quantitative roles including [DRW](https://drw.com/) as a quantitative researcher, [Hudson River Trading](https://hudsonrivertrading.com/) as an algorithm developer and [Uber's Former Self Driving Department](https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/) as a researcher. I have also interned in software engineering roles, including at [Citadel](https://citadel.com/), [Rippling](https://rippling.com/) and (now defunct) [Ivy Global](https://ivyglobal.com/). 

Lastly, I will be competing in the 2023[^1] [ICPC World Finals](https://worldfinals.icpc.global/) representing CMU with my teammates [Edward Xiao](https://codeforces.com/profile/4fecta) and [William Tsin](https://codeforces.com/profile/BucketPotato). We previously teamed to place 1st in US and 2nd in NA at the [ICPC North America Championship](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/North-America-Championship-2023-2023/standings). A few years before this, I represented team Canada at the [International Olympiad in Informatics](https://stats.ioinformatics.org/results/CAN), bringing home a gold medal.
